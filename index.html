                            As the old saying goes, variety is the spice of life, and you'll find plenty of variety at this family-friendly eatery. 
                            From traditional Korean barbecue dishes including Bibimbap and kimchi pancakes to contemporary creations like spicy pork ribs, Korean style box lunches, and beef galbi-jjim, Sura Hawaii's lunch and dinner menus are packed with flavor. 
                            Every table has its very own built-in stovetop, allowing guests to look on as a member of the wait staff cooks their meal.</p>
